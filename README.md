# Interactive Baking
Introducing Extra Sensory Input into the Baking Experience

## Why Baking? Why Make it Interactive?
Not only is cooking an important life skill, but cooking can be an outlet of creativity and mindfulness. Our motivation is to get more people to enjoy the experience of cooking no matter their age. children tend to have a shorter attention span and learn better with additional sensory experiences, and baking often includes many stretches of time with repetitive tasks or waiting that could bore young children and make it harder for them to stay engaged with the process. Thus, we want to make it easier for children to stay on task and not be bored during these moments by adding sensory experiences. We want to prioritize multiple forms of sensory input with images, videos, and reactive graphics in order to make the baking process as captivating as possible for younger children. Our Interactive Baking set is targeted at children but is fun for the whole family!

## What's in the Set? How is it Interactive?
The Interactive Baking set is currently made up of three bakig tools and an interactive Multitaction Surface. There is the Happy Bowl,  Liquid Sensor Measuring Cup, and a Singing Whisk. 

## Happy Bowl: Visual Encouragement and Guidance
The Happy Bowl has an LED panel and a weight sensor so it can give visual feedback when ingredients are added and the user is progressing through the recipe. The Happy Bowl's weight sensor can sense when ingredients are added to the bowl and can then change dthe LED display from a red sad face to a green happy face. This offers encouragement for completing the next step of the recipe.
